        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Bitcoin is more than a currency—it’s the world’s most resilient store of value, decentralized, scarce, and immune to inflation. Traditional nonprofit reserves dwindle as fiat currencies lose value, but SOLON’s Bitcoin treasury grows stronger over time, ensuring your donation delivers exponential impact.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Inspired by visionary companies that have embraced Bitcoin as a reserve asset, SOLON is pioneering this model in philanthropy. By donating Bitcoin, you’re not just giving—you’re investing in a future where social good thrives on sound money.
