        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Bitcoin is the ultimate store of value—decentralized, scarce, and resistant to inflation. Unlike fiat-based
          nonprofit reserves that lose purchasing power over time, SOLON ensures that your contributions grow in
          strength rather than diminish.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Our treasury model is inspired by pioneers like Strategy, which successfully adopted Bitcoin as a treasury
          reserve asset. Just as they leverage BTC to maximize long-term capital efficiency, we leverage Bitcoin to
          create perpetual funding streams for impact-driven initiatives.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          By holding Bitcoin, we lead the future of philanthropy—one that is independent, transparent, and optimized for
          sustainable social change.
